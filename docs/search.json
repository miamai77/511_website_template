    "text": "The Far Right’s broad resurgence is probably one of the most noteworthy trends in the 21st century’s global political landscape, and additionally politicians representing this shift to the right have gained prominence in not only the US, but in states such as Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Italy, and Japan. It remains increasingly clear that this trend may be semi-permanent, with over a decade of increasing support for such movements among individuals of all walks of life. “Right wing authoritarianism” is a term not only describing a political identity but a set of beliefs and morals potentially bridging the gap between political science and psychology. A “right wing authoritarianism” scale was developed by psychologist Bob Altemeyer in 1981, describing a set of tendencies that might make one more predispositioned to supporting a right-wing authoritarian leader. These tendencies include high levels of submission to established authorities, willingness to engage in retaliatory actions to protect such authorities, and high degrees of conventionalism and traditionalism, whatever that may be in one’s culture. I will attempt to map such values in the United States, and the county-by-county spatial variance between them. I will take state-by-state or metro-by-metro survey data corresponding with right-wing authoritarian tendencies as defined by Altemeyer, and use a regression model to predict what socioeconomic traits could suggest right-wing authoritarianism in geographic regions.\nPerhaps class is a primary predictor of RWA, or urban-rural location, or perhaps Pentecostalism. Modeling RWA by county will allow me to see the factors that correlate the most."
